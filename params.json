This is the stable branch\r\n2. **New_Yourname** : When you want to upload a new shader create a new branch named `New_Yourname` from `Master` and don't forget to ask some feedbacks if you need it. Your branch will be merged with the `Master` branch at the end\r\n3. **Update_Yourname** : Basicaly when you want to polish or update any file. Create a new branch from `Master` branch, name it `Update_Yourname` and add modification to something that exist allready. Don't forget to ask some feedbacks if you need it. Your branch will be merged with the `Master` branch at the end\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how github work look at this beginning article https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ or `ask me` for help\r\n\r\n**Have fun**  :smiley:\r\n\r\n# Rules :\r\n- Don't post what's not yours (duh) but you can post shaders or renders if you have the direct autorisation of the creator and explain what we do here with the direct link to the project (https://github.com/Astuceman/Daz-Iray-Shaders)\r\n- English is the default language (duh)\r\n\r\n# Folders Rules :\r\n- `Shaders`               Shaders <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wvOotDR_cuI\" target=\"_blank\">.DSA</a> files + icon\r\n\r\n - We don't accept .DUF files (default format) because it's unreadeable by an text editor.\r\nYou need to export shaders in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wvOotDR_cuI\" target=\"_blank\">.DSA</a> format\r\n - You need to post the file shader and his picture who is generated at the same time (XXX<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wvOotDR_cuI\" target=\"_blank\">.DSA</a>.png)\r\n\r\nRender of ball scene to see how the shader look\r\n\r\n - You need to render every shader you put in the `Shaders` folder and put it in the same folder\r\n - Load `material ball scene` select (everything are allready selected by default) `DAZ Material Ball` and create or apply the shader on `OuterSphere` and `Stand` and render the scene by default\r\n - The name of the render need to have the same name of the shader\r\n - When you post a shader with \"Emission color\" (light) you need to render it twice. One time like everyone. Second without light from camera (Choose \"Explore camera\" then clic on \"Headlamp\" then \"Headlamp Mode\" choose \"Off\") and light from scene (Open \"Render settings\" then clic on \"Environment\" and choose \"Scene Only\" in \"Environment Mode\"). The second render will have the same name like the first with one difference : Need to place (DARK) after the name like this : XXX (DARK).png\r\n\r\n- `Example-renders`       Example render of one shader in many situation (no rules)\r\n\r\n - The name of the render need to have the same name of the shader\r\n - The dimension of the render need to be 1280 x 720 (16:9) or 720 x 1280 (9:16)\r\n\r\n- `Stress-test`           Test scene to figure out if your shader work in every situations\r\n\r\n - The scene inside the folder are for test purpose ,use this to try your shader in different lighthning and situations\r\n\r\n# Planed in the future :\r\n- shaders with texture\r\n- material preset\r\n\r\n# Copyright :\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n",
